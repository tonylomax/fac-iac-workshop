# FAC IAC WORKSHOP

- In this repository should be everything you need to learn about ~~all~~ some things IAC.
- Each section of the readme below refers to one of the folders.

## Server

- This folder contains all the code we're actually going to deploy and the README in there has some useful information.

## Terraform

- This folder has an example of how you could complete the assigned work using terraform. It doesn't include everything and maybe don't trust everything you see in there...
- It's not the only way of using terraform and don't just copy and paste things - only use this if you're really struggling.
- If you're really really struggling then [Elena](https://github.com/cazanelena) has created a full terraform repository with everything you need to spin up our microservice, you can see it [here](https://github.com/cazanelena/aws-workshop-terraform). Only use this if you're completely lost and have exhausted all other possible learning options (asking me, asking Elena, asking each other, googling etc).

## AWS-CDK

- This folder has an example of how you could complete the assigned work using the AWS CDk.
- Same rules apply as above.
- Really really only look in here if you're completely stuck as the implementation is a lot shorter than you might think with CDK.

### Final thoughts

- Take your time and read the documentation.
- You may find it easier to start with one part of project and get that working and moving on the next one.
- The feedback loop in DevOps work can be slow. So make one change, check it and if that doesn't work try the next thing.
- If you're struggling between deciding one approach over another or need some general guidance this handy site has some useful advice - https://askastaffengineer.com/.

Good Luck!
