## FAC IAC WORKSHOP

- In this repository should be everything you need to learn about ~~all~~ some things IAC

## Server

- This folder contains all the code we're actually going to deploy and the README there has some useful information.

## Terraform

- This folder has an example of how you could complete the assigned work using terraform. It doesn't include everything and maybe don't trust everything you see on the internet...
- It's not the only way of using terraform and don't just copy and paste things, only use this if you're really struggling
- If you're really really struggling then [Elena](https://github.com/cazanelena) has created a full terraform repository with everything you need to spin up our microservice, you can see it [here](https://github.com/cazanelena/aws-workshop-terraform). Only use this if you're completely lost and have exhausted all other possible learning options (asking me, asking Elena, asking each other, googling etc)

## AWS-CDK

- This folder has an example of how you could complete the assigned work using the AWS CDk.
- Same rules apply as above BUT ALSO the code in here is actually not that long (around 20-30 lines) so if you look at once then it might ruin your learning because the temptation to copy/paste will be strong.
- So really really only look in here if you're completely stuck and just want to know how to do the thing.
